# API Testing with Newman

## Introduction

Welcome to the API Testing with Newman repository. This repository is dedicated to testing the Dmoney REST API using Postman collections executed with Newman. It provides comprehensive test cases, reports, and documentation for effective quality assurance.

## What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, making it easier to integrate different systems and services.

## Why Use APIs?

- **Integration**: APIs enable seamless integration between different applications and services, allowing them to work together efficiently.
- **Automation**: They facilitate automated processes by enabling systems to exchange data and execute tasks without manual intervention.
- **Extensibility**: APIs allow developers to extend the functionality of their applications by leveraging external services and resources.
- **Scalability**: They support scalable architectures by enabling modular and distributed application design.


## API Details

- **API Documentation**: [Dmoney API Docs](https://dmoney.roadtocareer.net/api-docs/)
- **Partner Key**: `X-AUTH-SECRET-KEY: ROADTOSDET`

## Newman Details

- **Newman**: Command-line collection runner for Postman.
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure Node.js is installed; install Newman globally with `npm install -g newman`.
